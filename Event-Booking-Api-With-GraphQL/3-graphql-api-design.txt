1.  We first think of the main entities that we have in this project. Since we are making event-booking-api, we need event
    objects and the users.

2.  Events and users are connected. Users can book events and events are being booked by users. Users can create events.

3.  Events data has CRUD operations. And the users are connected to these operations because they perform them. For 
    fetching the events, we can filter the events based on the user who created that event `created-by` or by the users
    who booked them `booked-by`.

4.  Regarding the users, users can be created `Create` and logged-in `Log`. Also, the users can interact with the events.
    They can book/cancel an event.
