/*  To persist our data we are using MongoDB. We can use any other database as well with GraphQL. GraphQL works with any
    database because we have to write the logic to interact with the database. We are using MongoDB Atlas which is hosted
    on cloud, inorder to avoid administrating and setting up database.
    
    Inorder to connect to database we need to do 2 things
    1.  In the MongoDB Atlas Clusters page, go to Security section to manage the security settings of the cluster to allow
        our application to connect to database.
    
    2.  We use a driver in our application to query our database. This is needed because we are not going to write queries
        but expose some methods that execute against the database

    In the Security section, we need to have atleast 1 user that is an Admin or can Read/WriteAnyDatabase. Then we need to
    specify which servers can connect to the database. To do this we need to add our local machine's IP address to the 
    IP Whitelist of database

    Then we use Mongoose, a third-party library which allows us to work with models. In this way we can manage our data 
    through JavaScript objects, for ex: we can save the objects, execute certain methods on it. All this is translated to
    a query that executes against the database.
    
    We install the package using the following command
    const mongoose = require('mongoose');

    Now instead of starting the server with `npm run start`, we create `nodemon.json` file. This file will be used by 
    nodemon tool and it will help us to add configurations for the nodemon. In this file we pass in the environment 
    variables that contain database sign in credentials. In this way we can use our credentials locally and later deploy
    them. This file will be automatically be consumed by nodemon. Also nodemon does not pick changes from nodemon.json.
    Therefore we need to restart the app.
