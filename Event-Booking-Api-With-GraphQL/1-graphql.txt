We will be making Event Booking API and App. We will build GraphQL APIs, use MongoDB, React.js Single Page Application and
create charts

--> What is GraphQL?
    GraphQL is an alternative to RESTful APIs. A RESTful API has endpoints and is independent of the clients connected to
    it. The RESTful APIs help to exchange data between the frontend and the backend. GraphQL offers more flexibility than
    the RESTful APIs.

--> Limitations of REST APIs
    REST APIs work with the endpoints. The endpoints return JSON data. Eg:
        {
            "id": 1,
            "title": "First Post",
            "content": "...",
            "creator": {...}
        }
    What if we need only `id` and `title`?
    We can simply send all the data but it would slow down the query process as lots of redundant data wil be sent to 
    backend.

        Solution 1                                 Solution 2                           Solution 3
    Create a new REST API Endpoint          Use Query Parameters                    Use GraphQL
    (e.g. GET /post-slim)                   (e.g. GET /post?data=slim)

    Problem: Lots and lots of Endpoints     Problem: API becomes hard to            Problem: None
    and lots of Updating                    understand

    With GraphQL we expose 1 endpoint which is very flexible regarding the query. This is because we expose a query 
    language to the frontend. This allows the frontend engineer request data in all kinds of shapes but the backend
    do not have to constantly edit the APIs.
