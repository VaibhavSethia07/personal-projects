`tsconfig.json` is a possibility to config TypeScript. We can provide some parameters in the config file so we need not to
provide them in the cli.`

`tsconfig` file has an object which has key `compilerOptions`. It has an object as value that stores the directory where we
store all the files `rootDir` and `outDir` stores the JavaScript files  

Store all the TypeScript files in the src folder and then run `tsc -w`. TypeScript will take all the files from the source
folder
