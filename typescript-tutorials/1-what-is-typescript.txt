TypeScript is not a language. It is an extension to JavaScript. It gives us the missing parts of JavaScript i.e datatypes.

--> Why TypeScript is better than JavaScript?
1. We get errors in transpiling phase and not in runtime. It doesn't mean we get no errors in runtime. But we will get
less errors in runtime.
2. It is difficult to maintain and scale JavaScript code. Because we can only define things with objects, arrays, strings
and so on. With TypeScript we can work with entities. eg. User

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript

Note: TypeScript can run on browser directly because browser doesn't support TypeScript. This means TypeScript needs to be
transpiled in JavaScript. The output we get is JavaScript which we can run on browser.
