Type Assertion means converting 1 type to another. 
We use `as` keyword for type Assertion

let s2: string=vUnknown as string;

To convert a data type (except any data type) to another we first have to convert it into unknown data type and then to desired data type
let pageNumber: string = '1';
let numericPageNumber: number = pageNumber as unknown as number;
