--> void data type
const doSomething = (): void => {
    console.log('doSomething');
}

--> any type is used when we don't know what we are returning. It is recommended to not use any data type.
const foo: any = "foo";
// No error
console.log(foo.bar());

--> unknown type is an alternative to any data type. The data with unknown data type cannot be assigned to any other data
type

let vAny: any = 10;
let vUnknown: unknown = 10;

let s1: string = vAny;
// unknown variable cannot be assigned
let s2: string = vUnknown;
