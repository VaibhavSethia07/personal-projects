We can give different name to a datatype using `type`

type ID = string;

interface UserInterface {
    id: ID;
    name: string;
    surname: string;
}

Even though ID and string have same data type but explicitly defining string as ID is architecturally important.

Note: type should start with capital letter

type MaybePopularTag = PopularTag | null;
