The easiest way to setup react application is to use `create-react-app`. It is built by Facebook and allows us to just
focus on building apps instead of configurations.

`create-react-app` uses Bable and Webpack. 

Bable- Bable is a JavaScript transpiler that converts the new JavaScript into the old JavaScript.
Webpack- Webpack is a module bundler. It will be bundling our resources, watching for changes and running Bable transpiler.

Inorder to use the new version of `create-react-app`, use `npx`
--> Install the package
npm i create-react-app

--> Create application
npx create-react-app <folder-name-of-the-app>

--> To run the app
npm start

Note- `create-react-app` does automatic reloading of our application after every change in the code.

                    Folder Structure
1. node_modules -   It contains all our dependencies.
2. package.json -   It contains the list of all the dependencies used in app
3. public folder -  It contains the index.html. The div tag with id='root' contains all our JavaScript code.
4. build folder -   This is not visible when we run our app with `npm start` command. We use the command `npm run build`.
This command sets up production ready build and build folder. The build folder contains everything minified. It contains
static assets. We can drag and drop this folder on Netlify.
5. src folder - It has App.css, App.js. The App.js contains all the components. We can change its name as well. We have
index.js where we target the `root`. `index.js` is JavaScript entry point.
6. .gitignore - Here we specify which files/folder need to be ignored in commits. Eg /node_modules, /build
