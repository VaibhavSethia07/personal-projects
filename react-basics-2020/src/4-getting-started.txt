In the `src` folder delete all the files (App.css, App,js, App.test.js, index.css, logo.svg, serviceWorker.js and 
setupTests.js) except the index.js. And clear the index.js file. So when we run `npm start` there will be error.

--> Creating a component
We need 2 things, a react dependency and a function. Since index.js is JavaScript entry point we will need some more code
as well.

--> We import the dependency using 
import React from 'react'

--> Inorder for React to know the function is a component, we must capitalize the function name. We can create normal/arrow
function. From the function created we return HTML (technically JSX)
Eg: 
function Greeting() {
    return <h4>This is Vaibhav and this is my first component</h4>;
}

Now we have to add the Greetings function into the index.html located in the public folder. To do this we import `ReactDom`
from `react-dom` package
import ReactDom from 'react-dom'

`ReactDom` has a render method which takes in the what we want to render (i.e Greeting) and where we want to render (i.e
'root')
ReactDom.render(<Greeting />, document.getElementById('root));

Now start the server.

Note: In React even though some tags don't have closing tag, we need to self-close them.
Eg: <Greeting></Greeting>
    or
    <Greeting />
