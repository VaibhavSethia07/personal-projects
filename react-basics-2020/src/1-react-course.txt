--> What is a Rect?
    React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is developed by Facebook in 2011. It is the most
    popular library for the user interfaces. Some of its competitors are Angular, Vue and Svelte.

    React is all about components. A component is an independent chunk of user interfaces. It can be as small as HTML 
    element or we can put entire application in 1 component.

    The benefit of using component is that we can built independent, isolated and reusable components. And then we can sum
    up the blocks together.

    We can have as many components we like but there will always be a root component.

--> Benefits of React
1.  Independence- We can build independent pieces of user interfaces. This means changing the layout/logic in 1 component
    will not break whole app.

2.  Reusablility- Once the component is ready we can use it all through out the app. But the component code is still stored
    at 1 place.

3.  Speed- Behind the scenes React is using virtual DOM. This means only the component that needs to be updated is affected.
    This is done without re-rendering the whole app.

    Eg- Twitter, uses React for the side-bar which has icons and text. We can make a component and use it all places by just
    adding the data. Same is the case with the posts. Every post has image, text and like, retweet button.
